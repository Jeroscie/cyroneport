Week 7-8
Basic web design principles and elements and Info graphics
 Haiku Deck
Was founded on the premise that simple, modern, and elegant slide decks should be the norm, instead of overly dense, difficult to read, and difficult to digest ones. Similarly, the service makes creating those presentations easy, thanks to its webapp (and iPad app). Slides made using Haiku Deck focus on imagery and graphics, with a few words per-slide, but you're free to customize your slideshows so they work best for the story you're trying to tell.

 Prezi
- Is a web-based tool for creating presentations (called prezis for short). It's similar to other presentation software like Microsoft PowerPoint, The service made waves when it launched years ago because it gave users the ability to create dynamic, fluid, non-linear presentations with great animations and motion effects that lend energy to a presentation that you won't get with a static series of one-after-the-other slides.
